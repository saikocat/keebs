## Hand-frosting Acrylic Middle Layer

The transparent acrylic middle layer surface is not great aesthetically (visible multiple layer lines) and doesn't diffuse light well (very glaring & harsh light instead). So I decided to just hand-frost it to address those aesthetic issues.

**TODO**: Add Photos Before & After

Using sanding pads is recommended versus sanding paper due to the non-flat/non-standard surface of the tenting middle layer.

### Parts

## Make Case Sound Less Hollow 

There is a lots of empty space between the PCB and the case, thus it creates an echo chamber for sound. So just fill in the case with dampening materials that can make up to **1/16 inches** or **2mm height**. Subjective to personal taste, but I prefer mine to be muted for office environment.

### Parts

* Any cheap shelf liner really (triple layers fill)
* Clear colour perforated seam liner that I used (triple layers fill) cos of transparent middle layer [Con-Tact Zip-N-Fit](https://www.amazon.sg/Tact-Zip-N-Fit-Non-Adhesive-Non-Slip-18-Inches/dp/B00FGPVT68)
* Non-adhesive 1/16" thickness [Butyl Sheet](https://www.amazon.com/Durometer-Smooth-Finish-Backing-Thickness/dp/B000MAEX88/) 


## Tenting with Rubber Balls

After trying (wasting money) with various bolts, I found a way easier solution to tent yet still easily adjust the height to your design. This is especially useful if you carrying your Iris to work, time to setup the bolt and screw/unscrew them is very time consuming (also the middle layer I had is unbalance making it super difficult to tent properly).

### Parts

* Keywords for your favourite shopping platform: Notebook Laptop Cooling Ball Skid Proof
* 2 x set (as each set only has 2 smaller balls, we want 4). [Sample Aliexpress listing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33003855450.html)

## Noisy Downstroke Stabilizer Wire Hitting Receptacle Lip in Mill-Max Pre-Built PCB

As I found out the top 1u for the thumb key is rather uncomfortable to reach and use, I switched to use 2u thumb key instead. This one really caught me off guard for months after the switchover. And I was slowly losing my mind over the noise despite doing all the tuning possible to the stabilizer's housing & wires.

The culprit is actually the stabilizer wires striking on top of the receptacle lips during downstroke. And the PCB is pre-built to support 2x1u by default.

### Solution

Put a band-aid over the receptacle lips or any thin dampening adhesive material on top of it.


## Matching Wrist Rest Size

This is also a personal preference but I found the perfect matching size for each half of the Iris to be the [Kensington ErgoSoft Wrist Rest for Standard Mouse K50432WW (White)](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/ergonomic-desk-accessories/ergosoft-wrist-rest/ergosoft-wrist-rest-for-standard-mouse-K50432WW/) and [K52802WW (Black)](https://www.amazon.sg/Kensington-Ergosoft-Wrist-Standard-K52802WW/dp/B01MS8PIX9).


## Lube and Film Your Switches

I think the utmost importances for both acoustic and feels are lubing and film your switches. This also boiled down to personal preference. But it is really worth it.

I used these switches and lube guides for my Iris Mill-Max hotswap. And I can vouch for the insane improve they have.

* **Gazzew U4S** - Silent Tactile suitable for office use. Lube only the side-rails and donut lube the spring as this helps the high pitched upstroke in them. Followed [Gazzew's Official Guide](https://www.reddit.com/user/hbheroinbob/comments/edlx0q/about_lubing_and_assembly_linears_and_tactiles/)
* **Cherry MX Hyperglide Black** - December 2020 batch, linear switch, spring swap to TX 14mm springs 62g, plus Deskeys switch film, lube with Krytox 205g0 for that smooth linear feel. My personal favourite now! Followed [Keybored's Lubing Guide](https://youtu.be/GTfFtWCerns?t=509)
