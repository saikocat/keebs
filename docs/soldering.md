# [WIP] Soldering Tools and Guides

These are the tools and guides I used and learned from when I started to learn
how to build and solder keyboards.

## The Essential Tools


### Soldering Tips

**Hakko T18-C08** (if you use Hakko FX888D like mine) or **C shape** tip which 
has shape like a cone or column cut at a slant. I found this useful for drag 
soldering (SMD diodes) and it works with through-hole as well.

**C08** (0.7 - 0.8mm) tip is the right size for most of the keyboard components
soldering (well at least for open-source split keyboards):
* Surface mount diodes (`1N4148 SOD-123`) on PCB.
* Through-hole (Mill-Max SIP Socket, Pin, Receptacle, Rivet, Glass Diode).
