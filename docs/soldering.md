# [WIP] Soldering Tools and Guides

These are the tools and guides I used and learned from when I started to learn
how to build and solder keyboards.

## The Essential Tools


### Soldering Tips

**Hakko T18-C08** (if you use Hakko FX888D like mine) or **C shape** tip which has shape like a cone or column cut at a slant. I found this useful for drag soldering (SMD diodes) and it works with through-hole as well.

**C08** (0.7 - 0.8mm) tip is the right size for most of the keyboard components soldering (well at least for open-source split keyboards):
* Surface mount diodes (`1N4148 SOD-123`) on PCB.
* Through-hole (Mill-Max SIP Socket, Pin, Receptacle, Rivet, Glass Diode).

### Care for Soldering Tips

Weller has a pretty [good article](https://www.weller-tools.com/how-to-care-for-soldering-iron-tips/) on how to care for your soldering tip. I have also prepared a PDF for your viewing pleasure offline at this [mirror](https://github.com/saikocat/files/blob/master/keebs/soldering/doc/weller_-_how_to_care_for_soldering_iron_tips.pdf).

The section on *"Tinning Your Tips"* is especially useful. I'm going to copy and put it verbatim here:

#### Tinning Your Tips

You should tin your tips before and after each soldering session, as well as in between soldering every two to three joints. You want to keep your tip tinned at all times, from the first time you use it until you discard it. When you tin a tip, you cover it with a thin layer of solder.

Tinning stops your tips from oxidizing by creating a protective layer between the air and the iron. It's essential to keep your tip tinned, since iron oxidizes rapidly. Oxidation prevents the tip from transferring heat efficiently. Preventing oxidation through tinning extends the life of your tips.

Keeping your tips tinned also helps make soldering easier. It helps your solder wire melt and flow better, making soldering easier. The coating creates a heat bridge between the tip and the part you're soldering, which increases the efficiency of the heat transfer.

To tin a tip, follow these steps. First, clean the tip. Then, apply fresh solder to the tip. Use a small amount â€” enough to coat it thoroughly. The tip should still appear shiny.

If you are just starting your session, begin soldering as soon as you finish tinning the tip. Throughout a project, clean and then tin your tip after every few joints. If you're tinning a tip after completing a project, wipe the tip again briefly after tinning and then turn the iron off and put it away
